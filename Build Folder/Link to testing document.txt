When playing the current build for the game keep in mind that if there are any issues with the game please report them using the 
bug testing table, the link is provided at the end of this document. It is important to report any issues which pop up no matter 
how small because if they happen once they will ost likely happen a second time. Thank you for your continued support. 

Ryan Hood, 

If you have any issues with starting the game let me know and I can include a start-up guide.
